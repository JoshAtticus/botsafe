# Botsafe Project
Learn from previous security-related Meower bot mistakes before you make yours. Botsafe aims at educating bit developers about security risks when developing bots for Meower, and how to mitigate them efficiently. We also evaluate the security of bots made for Meower and identify security risks, and write public reports about bot security compromises.

## Why does security matter?
Security is critical when it comes to making Meower bots. Whether you're making a simple chatbot, or doing something more advanced like an Artificial Inteligence test, or a code evaluation bot. The last thing you want for your bot is for it to be compromised, which has happened multiple times in the past.
